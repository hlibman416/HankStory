In 2018 Unai Emery took over as manager for the mighty Arseanl. He instantly revolutionized the team and made Arsenal a force in the premier league once again. By the end of his first season as manager Arsenal won the title and reclaimed their title of Premier League Champions!
Unai brought an energy that hasn't been felt in the club for many years. He was able to go out and get players to fill some of the key holes the team has dealt with recently. He has also secured the loyalty of not only the team but the fanbase in his first season.
Emery proved himself as a decent manager after a very lousy previous performance with Paris Saint-Germain (the best club in Europe). He could not take advantage of the incredible talent PSG had to offer, and did not last long in the French capital. Let's hope he can keep this up in Arsenal. 

Back when Arsenal was the personal fiefdom of Arsène Wenger, the players would finish training and sometimes feel they could do it all again. Modern professionals are supposed to need a sleep after training. Wenger’s usually did not.It is a different story now. Under Unai Emery the players know they have worked, and they certainly sleep. It is one example of the shifting sands at the club but, when the broader picture is laid out, it adds up to revolution.
